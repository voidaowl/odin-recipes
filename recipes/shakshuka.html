    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached
      eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic. It's
      usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner,
      served with lots of bread to mop up the sauce.
