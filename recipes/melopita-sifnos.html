  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>660g ricotta (1lb, 7&frac14; oz), at room temperature</li>
    <li>100ml runny honey (5 &frac12;), plus extra for drizzling</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperate</li>
    <li>1&frac12; tbsp cornflour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste</li>
    <li>zest &frac12; lemon</li>
    <li>ground cinnamon</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pre-heat the oven to 160&deg;C (320&deg;F). Grease a round loose bottomed
      18cm (7 inch) cake tin with a little olive oil before lining both the
      bottom and the sides with baking parchent.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon or a whisk to beat the ricotta until
      smooth. Beat in the honey, followed by the eggs, one by one, the
      cornflour, the vanilla, and the lemon zest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scrape the mixture into the prepared tin, smoothing the top with the back
      of your spoon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the middle is set not jiggly, and it has
      started to colour around the sides.
    </li>
    <li>
      Leave to cool in the tin before transferring to a plate and drizzling with
      just enough honey to cover the top, and sprinkling with a generous amount
      of cinnamon. Enjoy!
    </li>
  </ol>
